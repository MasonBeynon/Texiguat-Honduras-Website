The tale says that the people who were involved in this construction, the witches, covered up the roosters so that they would not sing, and therefore would not bring day. If day never came, then the church would never be finished. But one lady couldn't cover the rooster so it sang. This cry of the rooster caused it so that the church only has one bell tower, so even through the church was never fully finished, it was built.",

      "description": "Before Moraz치n, Texiguat was a place important to the Spanish Colonials. September 15, 1821 in Guatemala City, Central America became independent from Spain. The document that had the agreement with Spain arrived in Comayagua on the 28th of September 1821 in the morning. That night, it arrived in Tegucigalpa. October 1, 1821, the people transporting the document were on their way to Nicaragua and stopped in the church in Texiguat. The mural displays two men, priest Jos칠 Antonio M치rquez and Joaqu칤n Rivera. Marquez was the priest of the church at the time, and Rivera was his assistant. Rivera later became head of state. They were there to receive the document of independence at the church. This mural represents that moment.",

The Spaniards ordered his death and killed him. In honor of that day, July 20, the people of Texiguat celebrate him. His name was Lempira. He can be seen on the one lempira bill of Honduran currency, which are named after him.",
      "morazan": "Francisco Moraz치n is the next person in this mural. He had a different situation, because his parents was not of Spanish origin, but Italian. His parents were from the island of Corsica, and they called Moraz치n the Corsican President. During the famous Civil War of Central America, one side wanted complete independence, and the other wanted to be a part of Spain or Mexico. 1827, Moraz치n enters the fight, one year before his barracks in Texiguat is built. From 1827-1842, there were 19 battles which were called the Fights of Liberty."

While this building is being made into a museum of Moraz치n efforts will be taken to make sure this mural is not damaged. The reason why this mural is placed here is because on the other side of the wall is the room where Moraz치n lived. This building will be 200 years old on June 4, 2028. Jaguars were important to the indigenous culture of Texiguat, and the jaguar is added to represent the strength of Moraz치n's soldiers."
